Introduction

The Transportation Management CLI Application is a powerful and intrusive solution designed to streamline transportation management operations. It empowers transportation service providers to efficiently manage their fleet, customers, cargo, and schedules. This application allows for the seamless handling of passenger bookings, cargo tracking, and gathering feedback from customers and drivers.
Problem Statement

In the field of transportation management, challenges include managing fleets, customers, cargo, and schedules efficiently. Existing problems include inefficient fleet management, customer and cargo management challenges, and the need for streamlined operations.
Solution Overview

Our solution addresses these challenges by developing a Command-Line Interface (CLI) application. Key features include customer information management, order history, efficient cargo management, and the ability to generate reviews from customers and drivers.
Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

Our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) includes the following key features:

    Schedule Management
    Passenger Booking and Rating
    Vehicle Management
    Data Persistence with SQLAlchemy
    Relational Database Design
    Command-Line Interface (CLI)
    Cargo Tracking

Technologies Used

    Python as the core programming language
    SQLAlchemy for database interaction
    SQLite as the relational database system
    Command-Line Parsing Library (e.g., argparse or click)

## Future Plans

While the Transportation Management CLI Application is already functional and valuable, we have plans to enhance and expand its capabilities in the future. Some of our upcoming features and improvements include:

- **Advanced Reporting:** Implement advanced reporting and analytics features to provide insights into fleet performance, customer satisfaction, and cargo management.

- **User Authentication:** Introduce user authentication to provide secure access to the application, allowing different user roles with specific permissions.

- **Integration with Mapping Services:** Integrate with mapping and GPS services to optimize routes, monitor vehicle locations in real-time, and provide accurate estimated arrival times.

- **Mobile Application:** Develop a mobile application version for passengers, allowing them to book and track rides conveniently from their smartphones.

- **Enhanced Cargo Tracking:** Expand cargo tracking capabilities with more advanced features, such as real-time cargo monitoring and delivery notifications.

- **Scalability:** Design the application architecture to be scalable, enabling it to handle larger fleets, more customers, and increased cargo volumes.

- **Community Contributions:** Encourage and welcome contributions from the open-source community to improve and extend the application's functionality.

These future plans represent our commitment to continuously improving the Transportation Management CLI Application to meet the evolving needs of transportation service providers and passengers.

We appreciate feedback and ideas from our users and contributors, and we look forward to making this application even more powerful and user-friendly in the future.
